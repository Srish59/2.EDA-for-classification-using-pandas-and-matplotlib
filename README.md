2. Write a program to perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for using Pandas and Matplotlib.
Aim: To write a program to perform Exploratory Data analysis (EDA) for Classification using Pandas and Matplotlib.
Requirements: Jupyter notebook, Sample Data set.
Procedure:
1 Firstly, open jupyter notebook using command prompt or anaconda navigator. Upload the sample dataset i.e.; car_prices.csv file in the notebook.
2. Now, open a new Python3 Kernel and perform the Data analysis.
Result: Hence, Exploratory Data Analysis is performed for Classification using pandas and matplotlib.
